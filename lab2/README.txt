LAB 2: INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC WITH MULTIMEDIA LOGIC (README)
1/26/18
1D, Carlos Ramirez


	This lab was very interesting to me because it is the first time I      worked with MML. At first, I was very intimidated by the application because I  had no experience with this kind of work whatsoever. I was very confused by the odd appearance of the display, especially because it looked outdated. However, I was surprised at how easy it was to use MML. I learned about all the tools in  the palette, and how to apply them to build logic gates. I also learned how to  play around with switches to affect the output of a circuit. Another skill I    learned was how to implement truth table to the logic gates. I am able to       receive specific outputs using AND, OR, XOR, and inverse gate operators. The AND and OR gate operators worked well for me, but using the XOR gate operators were difficult at first.  
 
	To make my own 7-segment display in part B, I would use 8 LEDs. I would also have 8 switches that can be toggled to make the lights light up. In the    case of the 7-segment given in MML, I have four switches with the first switch     turned to 1 and the other 3 switches turned off to 0. This way, if you don’t have   your own 7-segment display, you can improvise and make your   own.  

	I know from previous computer science classes that a random number      generator works using a seed. From what I remember, the seed is given to the    random number generator from the user. I believe the random number generator then  uses a complex algorithm to return a random number. However, this number is  not truly random, and, in fact, it is called pseudo-random. This is because you  can get the same “random” number by using the same seed. 

	Like I said in the previous paragraph, things in a computer cannot      really be random because they are always somehow deterministic. In the case of a random number generator, the “random” number you are using is a pseudo random  number generated using an algorithm. Since the number can be reproduced using   the same seed, you know that it is not truly random. Everything else in a       computer is also technically not random because everything is determined using  logical algorithms.
